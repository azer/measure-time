## Install

```bash
$ npm install measure-time
```

## Usage

Pass functions to measure-time with a title:

```js
var time = require('measure-time')

time('testing', function (done) {
  // ...
})
```

Once everything your module is defined, all functions you defined will be called
with a done function that should be called once the function is done its job:

```js
var time = require('measure-time')

time('do something', function (done) { // done can be called also as "t" to mock tape
  dosomething()
  done()
});

time('do something async', function (done) {
  doSomethingAsync(done)
})
```

Once you write a module like above, you can run it like a regular Node module:

```bash
$ node example
```

It'll run the functions you passed for 9999 times by default. You can choose how many times you want to run by:

```bash
$ node example -t 12345 # or: --times 123455
```

And it'll give an output like the screenshot on top. See the `example.js` in the repo
for another example.

To see all the command-line options, pass -h or --help:

```bash
$ node example --help
```

Or see `docs/man` in this repo.
